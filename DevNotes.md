- SEO meta tags
- About page
  - "What is Tea Time"
  - Purpose (practice English, make connections, etc)
- Guidelines page
  - Rules
  - Tips for hosting
- Groups page
  - List groups with city, host names, thumbnail, contact button
  - "Host a group" button
- The website currently works as a single page app (navigating around) but if you try to go straight to a page (eg tea-time.social/guidelines) in your browser, you'll still get a 404
