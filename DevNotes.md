# Todo:

- Have a description blurb for each group (and make the "what happens at Tea Time" on the About page more generic)
- In the future, if this site actually becomes popular, we may want to give group managers a way to manage their group info (eg date & time meeting or description) without going through me. Like an "admin view".
- It might be interesting to have translations of this site available (eg English, Turkish, Pashto, etc) - however, we don't usually have many fluent speakers to if someone comes expecting that (based on the website) it might be hard. It *could* be a listing on each group, though.

## Dev Process

### Publishing

To publish a new version of the the site:

1. Make changes *(optionally: test changes with `npm run start`)*
2. Commit changes
3. Deploy changes publicly by running `npm run deploy`

### Instructions I followed to make this site
